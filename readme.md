# test 

testing git from Termux for android.  This repo was made 
entirely fom an android phone using Termux.

## install

install a text editor (vim or nano), python-dev, and 
freetype-dev.  I found python-dev better than python for `pip` 
installing packages that required a compiler.  freetype-dev was 
required for matplotlib.

```
apt install nano
apt install python-dev
apt install freetype-dev
```


Now setup your python environment with your favorite packages.
```
pip install pandas matplotlib bottle
```
